                            Dynamic Coffee Company (DCC) was founded November 1st, 2018 by Lydia Stiles. 
                            Lydia graduated from Western Governors University, with a B.S. in Software Engineering.
                            Lydia has a passion for serving the world delicious coffee.
                            It wasnt until she began her studies that she realized she could become the worlds best coffee seller.
                            With her newfound skills in Software Development, Lydia crafted an artistic, unique and responsive website that could represent her
                            business. Days after the website launched, business shot through the roof. 
                            Dynamic Coffee Roast went on to become the United States most preferred coffee brand by January 2023.
